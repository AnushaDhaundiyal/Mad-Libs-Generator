# Mad-Libs-Generator

<p style = "text-align:justify">A Mad Libs generator is a tool or game that creates a fun and often silly story by asking users to fill in the blanks with random words. The blanks typically require specific types of words, such as nouns, verbs, adjectives, or adverbs, but the user isn't told the context in which these words will be used. After all the blanks are filled, the words are inserted into a pre-written story template, often resulting in humorous and nonsensical narratives.

For example, a Mad Libs prompt might look like this:

Adjective: ___

Noun: ___

Verb (past tense): ___

Plural Noun: ___

Once the user provides words for these blanks (e.g., "silly," "dog," "jumped," "cars"), they are inserted into a story template to create something like:

Story:  "Once upon a time, a (adjective) (noun) (verb, past tense) over a bunch of (pural noun).

Output: "Once upon a time, a silly dog jumped over a bunch of cars."

Mad Libs are popular as party games, educational tools, and for creative writing exercises, as they encourage creativity and often result in unexpected and funny stories.</p>
